a short and informal life update: I have made the executive decision to start a blog!

I recently graduated from UC Berkeley and will be starting at Stanford University in the fall. one of my regrets during my undergrad is that I never gave myself a platform to publish some my thoughts, musings, and general findings, which leads us to here :&#41;

I mainly want to run this as a combination of a research journal, tutorials, and just documenting the cool things I'm working on; before I start my Master's degree this summer, I'll be continuing research at BAIR, so I'm looking forward to thinking a lot, implementing a lot, and hopefully writing a lot.

looking forward to seeing this bloom.
